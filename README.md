5. Navigate to the location of the repository

6. Run this command: ``vagrant up``

7. List status of running machines using: ``vagrant status``

8. Login to ansible-engine: ``vagrant ssh ansible-engine``

#
### Congrats! You can now work on Ansible.

## You can open SSH into the remote container from vs-code using [remote-ssh](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)

## To get the ssh config file for ansible-engine type ``vagrant ssh-config`` & copy the configuration for ansible-engine

### Copy the output your SSH config file â€” I added it to my default SSH config at ~/.ssh/config
### You can use this info to SSH into container through vs-code & write scripts easily

## To shut down the machines run: ``vagrant halt``
